# Sanctify

Sanctify is a gem that allows you to scan the git diff of any repo for secrets before you commit.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem install 'sanctify'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sanctify

## Usage

Run sanctify as part of the pre-commit hook, which will make sure to find and deny secrets before commit and PR. You can use the [precommit hook project](http://pre-commit.com/) to easily integrate this script with your repo. You can also run as a standalone command. If it fails, you'll get an exit code of 1 otherwise, 0 so you can very easily integrate it into bash scripts.

Sancitfy has very simple usage:

```
Usage: sanctify [-r REPO_PATH] [-c CONFIG_PATH] [-d FROM_COMMIT..TO_COMMIT | -d FROM_COMMIT]
    -r, --repo REPO                  Repo to test
    -c, --config CONFIG              Configuration file in YAML
    -d, --diff DIFF                  Specify a diff or commit from which to check secrets
    -h, --help                       Prints this help
```

To integrate with pre-commit, add the following to your `pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/onetwopunch/sanctify
    sha: v0.2.2
    hooks:
    -   id: sanctify
        args:
        - -c
        - sanctify.yml
```

## Configuration

Sanctify supports two top-level objects in the config: `ignored_paths` and `custom_matchers`. Currently sanctify supports a number of default matchers, but you are free to add more to your config file under custom_matchers. If there is a file that you know has secrets or is a false positive, you can add a list of Ruby-style regexes to ignore certain files.

Here's an example config file:

```yaml
---
custom_matchers:
  - description: "Test Description"
    regex: "secret.*"

ignored_paths:
  - test.*
  - .*thing.rb

```

The list of current default matchers are located in  `lib/sanctify/matcher_list.rb`:

```ruby
[
  {
    description: "AWS Access Key ID",
    regex: /AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}/
  },
  {
    description: "SSH RSA Private Key",
    regex: /^-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----$/
  },
  ...
]
```

If you see any problem with a default matcher list or would like to add another to the default list, please feel free to make a pull request.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
